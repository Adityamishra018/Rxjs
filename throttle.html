            The throttleTime operator in RxJS emits a value from the source observable, then ignores any subsequent values for a specified time duration. This process repeats, ensuring that emissions occur at a controlled and regular rate.

            Essentially it takes an event then shuts off for sometime. useful when you want to process only limited requests.
